# online-car-rental-system

In this we have 2 modules mainly
1) Car dealer module

-> Car dealer can add cars and modify the car details and can delete the cars.
-> Customer can select the cars based on the interest and then pay the amount based on the days count.

And we have used implemented a API for payment
